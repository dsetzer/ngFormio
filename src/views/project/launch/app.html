        <h3>Build a Distribution</h3>
        <p>To build your app and prepare it for hosting, you will need to compile it. If you are using one of our applications as the base, we provide a gulp task that will do this for you.</p>
        <p><pre>gulp build</pre></p>
        <p>This will build your entire application into the <strong>/dist</strong> directory. This will be a fully working version of your app that is ready for deployment.</p>

        <h3>Deploy to Hosting</h3>
        <p>Form.io based apps can be hosted anywhere that is able to serve files over http. Since all of the logic and functionality is done on the form.io backend, there are no special requirements for hosting the app. There are many good free hosts you can use to host your app or set up your own server.</p>
        <p>To deploy your app, make sure you have run <strong>gulp build</strong> and copy the contents of the <strong>/dist</strong> directory to your server host.</p>
        <p>We host many of our apps using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">github pages</a> which is free.</p>
        <p>Amazon s3 with cloudfront is a very good high performance alternative.</p>

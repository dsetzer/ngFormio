<h4>About Resources</h4>
<p>Resources are objects that can be used to create complex data structures within your application. The fields within a resource can be reused within other forms, as well as linked together to create complex nested resource relationships.</p>
<p>Form.io utilizes a <strong>form builder interface</strong> to create new resources, which not only creates the data model, but also automatically reflects that model onto a RESTful interface.</p>

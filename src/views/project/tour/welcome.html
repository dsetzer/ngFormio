  <h2>Welcome to Your New Project!</h2>
  <h3>This walkthrough will guide you through starting to build an application with Form.io</h3>
  <h4>First, get oriented with the Form.io portal.</h4>
  <h5>Project Settings</h5>
  <p>Project settings can be found in the light grey bar at the top of this page. You can upgrade your project to a higher plan, share the project with others using the Teams button or change the project settings with the settings icon.</p>
  <h5>Project Content</h5>
  <p>In the dark blue strip on the left hand side of the page you will find the contents of your project.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Resources and Forms are used to build the foundations of your application. Each Resource has a corresponding form for embedding. They are built using a drag and drop form builder. You can create and edit them using their respective pages.</li>
    <li>API - All forms and resources also have an automatically generated REST API that can be found in the API page. These are automatically attached to embedded forms and can also be used independently of the forms with a REST library.</li>
    <li>Data - Data that is sent to the API can be browsed using the Data page. You can browse, edit, create and download all the data submitted to the forms.</li>
    <li>Access - Each Form.io project comes with a full Role Based Access Control system. You can configure who has access to what forms and the data submitted to those forms using the Access page.</li>
    <li>Settings - The settings section is where you can change integration keys and control staging and remote environments for your project.</li>
  </ul>

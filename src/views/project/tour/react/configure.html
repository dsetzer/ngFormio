      <p>This step requires that that nodejs, npm and bower are installed. Bower can be installed after nodejs
        and npm by typing this in the terminal. Then install both node and bower dependencies by typing this in your terminal from the application base directory.</p>
      <p><pre>npm install -g bower</pre></p>
                      <pre>npm install

bower install</pre>

      <p><pre>var APP_URL = '{{ projectUrl }}';</pre></p>
      <h4>Running the app</h4>
      <p>You can run a development version of the application from the command line.</p>

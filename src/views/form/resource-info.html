<h4>About Resources</h4>
<p>Resources are objects that can be used to create complex data structures within your application. Resources can be referenced within other forms to create complex nested resource relationships.</p>
<p>Form.io utilizes a <strong>form builder interface</strong> to create new resources, which not only creates the data model and api, but also the resource form which can be found on the Forms page.</p>

<h2>Form.io Authentication</h2>
<p>Form.io comes with user management and full role based access control. Everything you need to create users and control their access to your project's data comes with each form.io project.</p>
<h3>User Management</h3>
<p>You can create multiple collections of users using Resources. For example, you can have a User, Manager, Supervisor and Admin resources to separate your users into different collections.</p>
<p>Users can then be created by submitting the resource form or creating a registration form that maps the submission to the user resource.</p>
<p>Allow users to get an JWT token by creating a login form using the <a href="https://help.form.io/userguide/actions/#action-authentication">Login</a> action.</p>
<h3>Roles and Permissions</h3>
<p>Define different <a href="https://help.form.io/userguide/roles-and-permissions/" target="_blank">roles</a> that can be assigned to form and submission permissions and are given to users.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://help.form.io/userguide/actions/#action-role-assignment" target="_blank">Role Assignment</a> action to assign various roles to the user resources to differentiate the permissions between them.</p>
<h5><strong>Your project comes by default with a set of resources already created along with login and register forms as well as all the required actions.</strong></h5>
